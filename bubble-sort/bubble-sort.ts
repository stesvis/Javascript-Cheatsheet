// Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms available.
// Itâ€™s frequently used as an introductory algorithm to help new programmers understand the concept of algorithmic sorting.

/**
 * Bubble Sort algorithm
 * Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
 * This process repeats until the array is sorted.
 * Time Complexity: O(n^2) in worst and average cases, O(n) in best case.
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
